<h2>Generation of Computers</h2>
The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
and affordable</em>.

<h3>Mathematics in Computing</h3>
A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.

<h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
